# Leaderboard: setup project

> In this activity you will set up a JavaScript project for the Leaderboard list app, using webpack and ES6 features, notably modules. You should develop a first working version of the app following a wireframe, but without styling - just focus on functionality. In following activities, you will consume the Leaderboard API using JavaScript async and await and add some styling.

## Built With

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Used [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) as bundler
- (Used Lighthouse, Webhint, Stylelint, and ESLint as linters)

## Live Demo

You can check a live working version of this project here: [live-demo](https://slowkingv.github.io/leaderboard/)

## Getting started

This project makes use of [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to bundle all the JS modules.

### Setup

Clone the repository into your local machine and then run `npm install` to download all the dependencies. Then after making any changes inside the `src/` folder, you can run `npm run build` to generate the corresponding files inside `docs/` directory.

### Run tests

If you want to test your changes on the fly without having to build every time, you can use `npm run start` to start the `webpack-dev-server` in development mode. This will watch for any changes you make and update the page accordingly.

To check the linters on your local env, make sure you have installed all dependencies (`npm install`). The files `.eslintrc.json` `.hintrc` and `.stylelintrc.json` contain the configuration files for the linters.
